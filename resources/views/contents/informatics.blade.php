  <h1>DATA CENTER SERVICES</h1>

    Data centers are where computing facilities and networking equipment are located and centralized. They are tasked to collect, store, process, and distribute large amounts of data. They are also responsible for data backup and recovery, as well as networking. These centers also host websites, manage e-mails, and instant messaging services. They support cloud storage applications and e-commerce transactions. That is why data centers are an indispensable resource for a business that wants to run their operation without worries.
    We have data center in Nepal private and Government own, but due to high cost and limited resources in Data Center we are not much comfortable. We are not able to provide fast delivery of our MUNERP solutions to the local governance as expected. So, we are planning to have our own complete, scalable, modern datacenter for our valuable customers.

    The business world is moving at an incredibly fast pace that matches the overwhelming demand for information. With the ever-changing requirements of the modern business model, many companies place their confidence in data centers, as these facilities play a crucial role in reaching their IT specifications.

They are becoming a valuable addition to many businesses as they prove to be a dependable extension of their IT team.
